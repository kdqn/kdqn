## Hey, i'm Cayden!
<!--
**kdqn/kdqn** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- I'm an aspiring software developer with my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Bemidji State University
- I love coming up with new ideas, making projects i'm proud of and that are usable to others, as well as spending time outside mountain biking and sailing among other hobbies.
- Check out my pinned repos/projects I've been working on!
